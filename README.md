# What is this?

This project, safestrtonum is a (joke) project which can safely and reliably transform a string to an integer or float depending on the string. It handles all errors with good error logging. This was made because int() doesn't like strings that are floats and errors out. It was made to solve that pain point.

# Why not take the easier approach of this project (in other words, int(float(string)))?

The easier approach isn't the approach where you'll learn the most. It's good for use but if you want to learn and have fun, always try the hardest approach. This was made as a joke project and was also meant to test out isinstance(). The spaghetti-er the code, the more learning it will bring.

# Can I use this?

Don't. Won't. Shouldn't.

# Summarize this project?

Safe String to Number (Integer, Float) is Python code designed to convert strings to their numerical type safely.
